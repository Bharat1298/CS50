1: SELECT (AVG(energy) + AVG(valence) + AVG(danceability)) / 3 AS Auido_Aura FROM songs;

2: The method I calculated might not be very representative of the listener because
   it looks at the top 100 songs that they've listened to equally. The listener might've
   listened to their top 10 songs 100 times more than they listened to their bottom 90.
   A better way to calculate the aura would be to see how many times they listened to each song and
   weigh it accordingly.

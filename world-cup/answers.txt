Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

There wasn't much difference between 10, 100, and 1000 simulations

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I would call 10000 simulations good enough
